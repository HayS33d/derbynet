<p>Another father and I were asked to handle all the technical requirements
for the pinewood derby this year for our pack.  I did some googling and found your
project on github and I can't say how awesome it is enough.</p>

<p>We ran 87 racers in just over an hour. It went so smooth that the only
request/complaint we had the entire day was that 1) it was going too quickly as
some parents missed a heat or two because it was going so well, and 2) if we
could have more screens and bigger projections next year.</p>

<p>The first year we were involved in the derby (my son is 8 and in the 3rd grade)
it was an absolute disaster. Technical issues took over an hour to resolve
before racing even started. Last year was better, but they still ran into issues
with using other software and laptop connections. This year, Ben and I were
determined to make it as flawless as possible. I don't think we could have
succeeded without your project.</p>

<p>We put up 4 laptops with 4 projectors in a "command center" style setup away
from the track and race organizer table. My wife managed the display center so
no one would bother the tech there, but she didn't need to do anything at all
with the system. It showed "on-deck," standings, heat results, etc., and the
parents loved it. </p>

<p>We ran it all from a Raspberry Pi 3 attached to the track itself with
velcro. Not a single glitch.</p>

<p>All the kids had a blast because everything just worked!  Thanks!!</p>

        <p>Our derby was yesterday morning and things went really well.  DerbyNet
        made things go really smoothly and quickly.  The timer functionality
        worked great! I want to thank you for all the work you put into updating
        the application with support for "TheJudge" timer.</p>

        <p>This was my first Pinewood Derby. I found DerbyNet to be intuitive
        and the documentation (when I needed it) to be thorough. I was relieved
        to find it and be able to completely sidestep the traditional (legacy?)
        Windows-only apps. </p>

        <p>I also got a lot of great feedback that is all to your credit.
        People loved the replays, slideshows of racers and cars, and they raved that we
        apparently executed the event in record time (57 scouts plus 12 family cars in 2
        hours).</p>

        <p>Thanks again for DerbyNet!</p>

     <p>Just thought I'd drop a quick note, letting you know that we had our event yesterday and it was a complete success!

<p>[I used m]y old windows XP laptop that I used as the web server, and also connected
        the timer to its com port.  I used an el-cheapo ("vulcan" brand) windows
        10 laptop for getting the kids checked in... when the kids arrived to
        get their car weighed, I would take their picture with the vulcan
        webcam, enter their car name, and slide the switch to checked-in.  After
        the kids left, I took photos of their cars with my phone, and then
        brought them over to the XP machine in a /cars folder.  I again used the
        windows 10 laptop to drag the car photos over to the appropriate
        racer. </p>
        
<p>On race day, I set up a wireless router so I could network the xp (connected
        to an overhead projector), windows 10 vulcan, and another HP windows 10
        machine, used for the "on deck" dislpay.  There were only a couple of
        kids that didn't bring their cars the night before, or I didn't get
        their name/photo.  So I displayed the "please check in" kiosk for that
        on the projector until they did so.  After that, I displayed the
        "slideshow" kiosk while everyone was still assembling.  I think the kids
        and parents got a kick out of seeing their kid, their car, and the names
        up on a big screen.  I kept this going while some grandparents did
        judging for best-looking and scout-themed car. </p>
        
<p>The racing couldn't have gone smoother.  I was keeping an eye on stuff, but
really things just moved from heat to heat very well.  There was one race where
something happened, and all of the cars had times that were very small (0.5
seconds or something).  I simply got rid of those results, redid the heat, and
went on.  After the race I examined the log file, and see the exact small-times
in there, so it must have been an issue with the track timer (or lights on the
sensors or such), not your software.  </p>

<p>It's people like you that make scouting fun, and the world just a bit nicer.</p>
