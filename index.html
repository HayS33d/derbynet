<h3>DerbyNet: Open-Source Pinewood Derby race management software</h3>

<p>DerbyNet is a free, open-source Pinewood Derby race management system based on a
        standard web server model.  (Don't confuse DerbyNet with the commercial
        GPRM product, "DerbyWeb.")</p>

<p>DerbyNet is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Distributed: Support as many check-in stations as you need, and as many
  information presentations.  You host a small, local web server on one laptop or computer; other
  computers, tablets, laptops, TV displays, or even phones connect to that
  computer to access live race information.</li>
<li>Free: There's nothing to pay for.  There are no licensing costs or subscription fees, no payments at all.</li>
<li>Open Source: If you'd like the software to work a little differently, or look a little differently, you're welcome to change it.  (Some skill required, but not necessarily a lot.)</li>
</ul>

<p>DerbyNet supports two primary usage scenarios:</p>
<ul>
<li>Installed alongside GrandPrix Race Manager (Pro or Lite or whatever), as an
  enhancement that allows additional capabilities not offered by the GPRM core
  product.</li>
  
<li>Installed on its own, providing soup-to-nuts race management capabilities,
  including interacting with timer hardware.  DerbyNet can run stand-alone on
  Mac OS X and Linux, as well as on Windows.  Standalone DerbyNet also supports
  the included Mac Replay application, providing "instant replay" video
  capabilities.</li>
  
</ul>

<p>Both forms feature support for local digital signage (also called information kiosks), typically a web browser displayed on a TV, that connects to the web server and presents information about the race, check-ins, standings, etc.</p>

<p>It can be used standalone (directly communicating with your electronic timer),
or run alongside and as a supplement to GrandPrix Race Manager
(<a href="http://grandprix-software-central.com">http://grandprix-software-central.com</a>).
(Please note that DerbyNet is not endorsed or supported by Lisano Enterprises, LLC., the makers of GrandPrix Race Manager.)</p>

<p>Being web server based, DerbyNet lets you run multiple clients (browsers) in
multiple locations to access the same database.  A typical deployment might have:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Volunteers at the check-in desk performing registration and inspection tasks, using
laptops or tables to update the state of the roster in the database in real time;</p></li>
<li><p>One or more stations capturing photos of racers and/or race cars;</p></li>
<li><p>An event dashboard running on the race coordinator's tablet, from which s/he
can see the overall state of the event, control information displays, generate
racing schedules, and directly control racing by group;</p></li>
<li><p>A main race display projected onto a large screen showing the entrants in the
current heat and the heat results;</p></li>
<li><p>Supplemental information displays ("kiosks" or digital signage) providing
additional race details and statistics, updated in real time.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>The heart of DerbyNet is implemented as a standards-compliant web server, which you
can host on nearly any platform (Mac, Linux, or Windows).  We provide step-by-step
directions for setting up your web server.</p>

<p>Once the web server is set up, you can use anything that supports a browser (laptops,
tablets, smart TVs) to connect to the server and display or manipulate (with passwords)
the data.</p>

<p>DerbyNet has been "battle tested," having been used to run both pack and
district events in standalone configuration, as in other events as a supplement
to GPRM.</p>
