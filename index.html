<h3>DerbyNet: Open-Source Pinewood Derby race management software</h3>

<p>DerbyNet is a free, open-source Pinewood Derby race management system based on a
        standard web server model.  Being web-server based, DerbyNet lets you run multiple clients (browsers) in
multiple locations to access the same database.  </p>

        <img src="images/derby-room.png"/>

<p>A typical deployment might have:</p>

<ul>

  <li><p>Laptops or tablets at the check-in desk updating the state of the
  roster in the database in real time;</p></li>

  <li><p>One or more stations capturing photos of racers and/or race cars;</p></li>

  <li><p>An event dashboard running on the race coordinator's tablet, from which
  s/he can see the overall state of the event, control information displays,
  generate racing schedules, and directly control racing by group;</p></li>

  <li><p>DerbyTimer, a small cross-platform program forming the link between the
  track timer and the web server.</p></li>

  <li><p>A main race display projected onto a large screen showing the entrants in the
  current heat and the heat results;</p></li>
  
  <li><p>A Mac-connected webcam triggers an "instant replay" immediately upon each
  heat's finish.  (Instant replay is unfortunately a Mac-only feature for
  now.)</p></li>
  
  <li><p>Smart TVs acting as supplemental information displays ("kiosks" or
  digital signage) providing additional race details and statistics, updated in
  real time.</p></li>

</ul>

<a id="comprehensive-features" class="anchor" href="#comprehensive-features"

<span class="octicon octicon-link"></span>
</a>Comprehensive Features</h3>

<p>DerbyNet is:</p>
<ul>
  <li><p><b>Free:</b> There's nothing to pay for.  There are no licensing costs or
  subscription fees, no payments at all.</p></li>

  <li><p><b>Distributed:</b> Support as many check-in stations as you need, and
  as many information presentations.  Computers, tablets, laptops, TV displays,
  or even phones connect to a small, local web server, running on one laptop or
  computer, to access live race information.  The web server can even be hosted
  on a Raspberry Pi3 for a truly turn-key set-up!</p>

  <li><p><b>Multi-platform:</b> Anything that has a browser can connect to
  DerbyNet: smart TVs, laptops, tablets, you name it.  The DerbyNet web server
  itself can be hosted on Mac, Windows, or Linux, and requires minimal
  computational resources.</p></li>

  <li><p><b>Open Source:</b> If you'd like the software to work a little
  differently, or look a little differently, you're welcome to change it.  (Some
  skill required, but not necessarily a lot.)</p></li> </ul>

<p>DerbyNet offers a wide range of features and capabilities, many not found
elsewhere:</p>
<ul>
  <li><p>Multiple displays, simultaneously presenting different information to
  the audience, all controlled from one tablet-friendly dashboard.</p></li>

  <li><p>Integrated photo capture at the check-in/registration station.</p></li>

  <li><p>Race Scheduling using Young and Pope "Partial Perfect-N"
  charts</p></li>

  <li><p>Supports FastTrack, Champ, Smart-Line, and "The Judge" timers (more to come)</p></li>

  <li><p>Automatically calculates standings and results, updated in real time.</p></li>

  <li><p>Special "On Deck" display to help your car wranglers get ahead of the
  action.</p></li>

  <li><p>Real-time updates for check-in progress, including a "Please Check-In"
  display identifying who's yet to check in</p></li>

  <li><p>A slideshow display continuously updated as more racers check
  in.</p></li>

  <li><p>An award presentation display including car and racer photos</p></li>

  <li><p>Easy export of results to spreadsheet form.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Although DerbyNet is a full-featured race management system on its own, if
you already use GrandPrix Race Manager (Pro or Lite or whatever), DerbyNet can
connect to the same database used by GPRM.  That means you can adopt DerbyNet to
provide enhanced features (remote displays, etc.) while continuing to use your
existing GPRM installation. (Please note that DerbyNet is not endorsed or
supported by Lisano Enterprises, LLC., the makers of GrandPrix Race Manager.
Don't confuse DerbyNet with the commercial GPRM product, "DerbyWeb.")</p>

href="#derbynet-runs-on-mac-linux-and-windows" aria-hidden="true"><span
class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>DerbyNet Runs on Mac, Windows, Linux,
and Raspberry Pi</h3>

<p>The heart of DerbyNet is implemented as a standards-compliant web server,
which you can host on nearly any platform (Mac, Windows, Linux, or Raspberry
Pi).  <b><i>We provide step-by-step directions for setting up your web server
(see the Builds &amp; Documentation link at the top of the page).</i></b></p>

<p>Once the web server is set up, you can use anything that supports a browser (laptops,
tablets, smart TVs) to connect to the server and display or manipulate (with passwords)
the data.</p>

<p>DerbyNet has been "battle tested," having been used to run both pack and
district events in standalone configuration, as in other events as a supplement
to GPRM.</p>
